        <p>A user-application connection provides secure SLA bound access for users accessing workloads running in or across campus,dc, or different cloud providers environment. Security Group Tags [SGT] based user access policies are used to provide access to your application. This is an extra layer of security on top of your existing identity and MFA based access control. This will ensure lateral movement of threat across your environment is contained.</p>

        <div className={styles.header}><h1>Securing The Connection</h1></div>
        <img alt={"securing connection"} className={styles.img} src={security}></img>
        <p>A user-application connection can be secured in the network through encryption, identity verification, and user-application segmentation policies to control traffic. A user workload flow traffic can be staged through firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems for additional protection. Adherance to industry-specific standards would create a robust security framework for your user-application connection.</p>

        <img alt={"observing connection"} className={styles.img} src={visibility}></img>
        <p>Observability for an user-application connection, spanning across networking domains, entails monitoring key metrics such as traffic, latency, and error rates. You can write policies for these metrics to be continuously analyzed and visualized to detect anomalies and potential issues. This real-time insight will enable proactive management of the connection's performance, security, and health, ensuring seamless communication between various application components.</p>

        <div className={styles.header}><h1>Connection Transport</h1></div>
        <img alt={"connection transport"} className={styles.img} src={transport}></img>
        <p> Connection transport refers to the combination of routing technology and underlying network and routing infrastructure that ensures the Service Level Objectives (SLO) of the user-application connection are met. A network domain connection is a first class network tranport object that can be used to transport packets. By aligning with specific performance, reliability, and availability standards defined in the SLO, network domain connection serves as the backbone that guarantees the seamless and efficient communication required for the proper functioning of the user-application applications.</p>
